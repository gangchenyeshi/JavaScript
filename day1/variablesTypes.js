// Types of variables

// There are several types of variables in JavaScript. It is very important to remember them to lay a solid foundation:

//STRING(text)
//var string = "Hello";

//Number
// var num = 42;

//BigInt(Large Number)
// BigInt is a special type of number that is used to handle numbers that are too large for the number type: to use it, you must add n after each specified number.
// var huge = 2n ** 53n //** means "power"

//Boolean(True/False)
//var bool = true;
// var anotherBool = false;

// Object
// Objects are detailed variables into which several values are slipped, associated with properties (keys). This is the key / value system. We wrap the object with braces {} and separate the keys with commas:

// var object = {
//     size : "big",
//     color : "blue",
//     serialNumber : 42,
//     isCool : true
// };

// Array
// Tables are special objects: they act more like lists. They have no properties, only values, and are wrapped in square brackets []:
// var array = ["item", 3, true];


// Function

// null
